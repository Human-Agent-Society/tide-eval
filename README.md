**Evaluation infrastructure for self-evolving agents, on the [Harbor](https://github.com/laude-institute/harbor) task standard.**

An agent self-evolves when something it learned during a run persists
past it: memory, a skill library, an evolved harness, updated weights.
tide measures whether that state changes what the agent scores. It
supports two kinds of task.

**Autoresearch** is the kind of task that approaches such as DeepMind's
[AlphaEvolve](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/)
and [Karpathy's autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) try to solve:
usually it comes with one open-ended problem measured by a continuous
score, hours of budget, and a judge that scores each submission. The
optimal score is unknown, so a result is the best score reached and how
long it took to get there (or how many evals):

The judge holds all scoring code and data and scores every submission into a log. An optional final judge with hidden tests runs once on the best submission and locks the session. The reward and the submission log are written to one table shared by every run, where agents can be compared." width="100%">

**A stream of tasks** runs one agent through an ordered
[stream](docs/get-started.md#streams) of tasks, and it measures whether
the agent keeps getting better and carries what it learns into the next
task (the setting used in [AgentStream](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.00155)
and [CL-Bench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2606.05661)):

  <img src="docs/assets/readme-stream-light.svg" alt="One agent works through a stream of tasks in order. Each task runs in its own fresh container and is scored on its own, but the agent's memory directory is carried from task to task, with a snapshot kept at every step. Every task's reward is written to the same table as every other run, so the learning curve over the stream is a single query." width="100%">
</picture>

Tasks are written in the Harbor format. This infra supports evaluating
any agent that can work inside a container, and you can test your own
harness or method following
[running agents](docs/running-agents.md).

## Why not plain Harbor?

tide is built on Harbor. Harbor provides the runtime: the task format,
containers, agent adapters, the verifier, trajectories, `harbor job
resume`, and `harbor view`. tide builds on top of them and adds three features
specifically designed for evaluating agents that learn during the run.

| What tide adds | In code | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **A judge.** The agent can submit at any time, and the judge (instantiated in a separate container) scores and timestamps each submission. | `POST $JUDGE_URL/submit`<br>`-> {"score": 0.83, "best": 0.91, "remaining": 47}` | [`judge_server.py`](tasks/_template/environment/judge_server.py) |
| **Streams.** An ordered task list run and solved by one agent. tide snapshots the agent state after each episode and transfers it to the next. | `await Stream("wk1", tasks).run(lab, agent)` | [`stream.py`](tide/stream.py), [streams](docs/get-started.md#streams) |
| **One append-only table.** It stores every run, keyed by (task, agent, tags). tide provides various budget types for the agent runs, and provides common metrics for measuring self-evolving agents. | `metrics.auc(metrics.anytime(lab.df("trace")))` | [`store.py`](tide/store.py), [`budget.py`](tide/budget.py), [metrics](docs/metrics.md) |

Full design (how tide prevents reward hacking, task conventions, data
model, extensibility): **[docs/design.md](docs/design.md)**.

## Using tide

First run? **[docs/get-started.md](docs/get-started.md)** walks from
install to running and scoring a task.
**[docs/running-agents.md](docs/running-agents.md)** explains how to set
up a real agent, whether it is a common coding agent or your own. The
rest of the docs are outlined in **[docs/](docs/README.md)**. tide
provides both a CLI and a Python API, with example code for each below.

### Run

```bash
pip install "tide-eval[harbor]"    # or from a source checkout: pip install -e ".[harbor]"

tide list                          # what's runnable
tide fetch cl-bench                # download a benchmark's tasks (a source checkout has them all already)
tide run frontier-cs/frontier-cs-2-0-vllm-llm-serving-optimization --agent claude-code --model anthropic/claude-opus-5 --budget 2h
tide stream cl-bench --agent claude-code --model anthropic/claude-opus-5
```

`--budget` is time (`2h` / `30m` / `90s`; a bare number is hours); the other
budget axes are `--max-tokens` (e.g. `500k`) and `--max-evals`, which
needs a judge and so applies to autoresearch tasks. See
[budgets](docs/get-started.md#budgets).

#### No Docker? Develop locally, verify in containers

`--local` starts the task's own judge as a local process and runs your
command against it, with no containers involved:

```bash
tide run autoresearch/first-party/circle-packing --local \
  --command "python examples/random_search.py" --budget 30s
```

The judge code is the same, but nothing is isolated, so local rows are
never trusted results. Use local runs while developing and report the
numbers from container runs; the details are in
[get started](docs/get-started.md#no-docker-local-and-fake-runs).

With Docker, `tide run cl-bench/bsm-s01 --agent oracle` proves the real
pipeline end to end: the oracle runs the task's reference solution and
must score exactly 1.0.

### The Python API

A `Lab` is a directory. Each `run` call is one episode (one Harbor
trial), and `df` returns everything recorded so far as a pandas DataFrame:

```python
# Lab is asyncio-based: run this inside an async function or a notebook.
from tide import Lab, Budget, metrics

lab = Lab("runs/exp1")
row = await lab.run(
    "tasks/autoresearch/frontier-cs/frontier-cs-2-0-vllm-llm-serving-optimization",  # any task dir or Harbor registry id
    agent={"name": "claude-code", "model_name": "anthropic/claude-opus-5"},
    budget=Budget(
        time_h=2
    ),  # or max_tokens=500_000, max_submissions=50
    tags={"prompt": "v2"},  # free-form; each key becomes a df() column
)
row.rewards  # the judge's final verdict
row.uri  # the trial directory, for auditing

curve = metrics.anytime(lab.df("trace"))  # every submission's score, over time
metrics.auc(curve)  # the anytime score
```

Re-running any script resumes it. Reference:
[get started](docs/get-started.md) · [metrics](docs/metrics.md).

### Task streams

A `Stream` runs an ordered task list under one agent. Every task's
container mounts the same state directory (`$TIDE_STATE_DIR`), carrying
the agent's memory, skill library, or evolved harness from task to task:

```python
from tide import Lab, Stream, metrics

lab = Lab("runs/cl")
stream = Stream(
    "my-stream",  # the name; a new one reruns the same tasks from empty memory
    [  # ordered tasks, repeats allowed; repeating one measures forgetting
        "tasks/continual-learning/terminal-bench/chess-best-move",
        "tasks/continual-learning/terminal-bench/build-pmars",
        "tasks/continual-learning/terminal-bench/chess-best-move",
    ],
)
rows = await stream.run(
    lab,
    agent={"name": "claude-code", "model_name": "anthropic/claude-opus-5"},
    budget="30m",
)

df = lab.df("episode")
metrics.learning_curve(df, by=["stream"])  # reward by position in the stream
metrics.forgetting(df)  # the score change on the revisited task
metrics.transfer(df, baseline_df)  # against the same tasks run alone (plain lab.run)
```

Re-running the same stream resumes it. A stream's identity is its name plus
its agent, tags, budget, and task list; changing any of those makes a
separate stream with its own memory, and a new name reruns the same tasks
from empty memory. On the CLI that name is `--name`, defaulting to one
derived from the targets. Each task is an ordinary Harbor trial in its own
container, with memory snapshotted at every step, so a crashed stream
resumes where it left off. Full details:
**[docs/get-started.md](docs/get-started.md#streams)**.

### Evaluate your own agent

Every task gives your agent a `$JUDGE_URL` and a submission budget. Whichever
way you integrate, the task, judge, and results store are identical, so
numbers stay comparable across methods:

| You have | Integration |
|---|---|
| a mainstream harness (`claude-code`, `codex`, `aider`, …) | `--agent <name> --model <m>`, zero code |
| your own harness | one `BaseAgent` subclass, referenced via `import_path`; runnable template: [`examples/minimal_harness.py`](examples/minimal_harness.py) |
| OpenEvolve, Codex, or CORAL | version-pinned runnable adapters: [`examples/run_harness.py`](examples/run_harness.py) |
| another method that isn't an "agent" (evolutionary search, a solver) | POST candidates to `$JUDGE_URL/submit`, stop at 429 (about 20 lines) |

Scores always come from the task's judge. Full guide:
**[docs/running-agents.md](docs/running-agents.md)**.

### Examples

[`quickstart.py`](examples/quickstart.py) and
[`stream_quickstart.py`](examples/stream_quickstart.py) run with zero setup.
With Docker, [`minimal_harness.py`](examples/minimal_harness.py) is the
smallest real harness and [`llm_harness.py`](examples/llm_harness.py) is the
same thing with a model proposing the candidates;
[`examples/harnesses`](examples/harnesses) adds OpenEvolve, Codex, and CORAL
as baselines. What each shows: [`examples/`](examples/README.md).

## Benchmarks

### Autoresearch

| Benchmark | Tasks | Upstream | Run |
|---|---|---|---|
| [first-party](tasks/autoresearch/first-party) | 6 | this repo | `tide run autoresearch/first-party --agent <a>` |
| [EdgeBench](tasks/autoresearch/edgebench) | 51 · 2-12 h budgets | [ByteDance-Seed/EdgeBench](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/EdgeBench) | `tide run edgebench/<task> --budget <h>` |
| [FrontierCS](tasks/autoresearch/frontier-cs) | 208 · 188 algorithmic + 20 research, incl. 4 GPU kernel | [FrontierCS/Frontier-CS](https://github.com/FrontierCS/Frontier-CS) | `tide run frontier-cs/<task> --agent <a>` |

Each first-party task covers one hard part of the category (held-out
grading, safely grading agent-shipped code, ...); the
[catalog](tasks/README.md) lists every task with its oracle score. The
[roadmap](https://github.com/Human-Agent-Society/tide-eval/issues/19) tracks
the next converters.

### Task streams

Three stream benchmarks. terminal-bench and CL-Bench tasks are committed
to this repo (Apache-2.0) and run out of the box, with a pinned
`fetch.py` to regenerate them; SWE-bench Verified's dataset repo has no
license, so its tasks are fetched onto your machine instead:

| Benchmark | Tasks | Upstream | Run |
|---|---|---|---|
| [terminal-bench](tasks/continual-learning/terminal-bench) | 89 · **v2.0 only** (1.x unsupported) · committed | [terminal-bench-2](https://github.com/laude-institute/terminal-bench-2) (Apache-2.0) | `tide stream terminal-bench --agent <a>` |
| [SWE-bench Verified](tasks/continual-learning/swebench-verified) | 500 · fetched (upstream has no license) | [harbor-datasets](https://github.com/laude-institute/harbor-datasets) | `tide fetch swebench-verified --limit 50`, then `tide stream swebench-verified --agent <a>` |
| [CL-Bench](tasks/continual-learning/cl-bench) | 301 · **all 6 domains** · committed | [continual-learning-bench](https://github.com/pgasawa/continual-learning-bench) (Apache-2.0) | `tide stream cl-bench --agent <a>` |

Of the benchmarks [AgentStream](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.00155) builds
its streams from, SWE-bench Verified is the hardest one with a published
Harbor version.
[CL-Bench](tasks/continual-learning/cl-bench) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2606.05661)) is
a continual-learning benchmark in the strict sense: sequential instances
of one environment where remembering should help, scored by the upstream
metric in every domain (its *gain metric* is `metrics.transfer`). Where a
domain has hidden state (the poker deck, the metered database), that
state is kept in a judge sidecar the agent can only reach over HTTP. A
stream also takes any task list you build yourself, repeats allowed; see
[streams](docs/get-started.md#streams).

### Define a new task

```bash
mkdir -p tasks/autoresearch/my-suite     # a new benchmark is just a folder
cp -r tasks/_template tasks/autoresearch/my-suite/my-task
pytest tests/test_task_suite.py          # picked up automatically, and already green
```

The template ships as a complete working task: replace one `TODO(task)`
piece at a time and the suite keeps validating it. A benchmark is just a
directory of such tasks; `fetch.register(name, repo, ref)` makes a
git-hosted one downloadable by name, the way gym environments register.
