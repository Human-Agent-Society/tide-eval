"""Episode executors.

An executor turns an :class:`EpisodeSpec` into an :class:`EpisodeResult`.
The Lab does not care how. That indirection keeps the core testable
without Docker and lets the same orchestration drive containers today and
anything else later.

- :class:`HarborExecutor`: the benchmark run (containers, judge sidecar,
  verifier). Harbor is imported lazily so the rest of tide works without it.
- :class:`LocalExecutor`: the development run, with the task's real judge
  as a local process and no containers.
- :class:`FakeExecutor`: deterministic, instant, dependency-free. Used by
  the test suite and the quickstart demo.

Executors recognize one tide-level override, ``state_dir``: a host
directory that :class:`tide.stream.Stream` carries across episodes.
Harbor mounts it into the agent's container at :data:`STATE_TARGET` and
sets ``$TIDE_STATE_DIR``; the local executor passes the host path itself.
The judge and verifier never see it.
