"""Core data types shared across tide.

The vocabulary is deliberately tiny:

- An :class:`EpisodeSpec` says what to run (a Harbor task + an agent).
- An :class:`EpisodeResult` is what an executor hands back.
- A :class:`TracePoint` is one judge-scored submission from *during* an
  episode.
- A :class:`Row` is what actually lands in the results store.

    from the episode's artifacts. ``uri`` points at the provenance (the
    Harbor trial directory) so every stored number stays auditable.

    ``agent_exit_code`` is the agent's exit status when it was not 0. A
    non-zero exit is not by itself a failed episode, since spending the whole
    time budget ends with the container being killed, so it is recorded as a
    fact rather than as ``error``.

    ``n_total_tokens`` (input plus output) and ``n_submissions`` (evals
