"""Task streams for continual-learning evaluation.

A :class:`Stream` runs an ordered list of Harbor tasks under one agent and
carries a state directory between them. Each task runs in a fresh
container with the directory mounted at ``$TIDE_STATE_DIR``; whatever the
agent writes there is visible in the next task. tide never reads the
contents; an agent that ignores the directory is simply a stateless
baseline.

The directory is snapshotted after every task and restored before the
next, so every task starts from a known state and a crashed stream
resumes cleanly. Episode keys cover the task list up to each position:
appending tasks extends a finished stream, while editing an earlier task
re-runs everything after it.

Rows land in the Lab's store tagged ``stream`` and ``position``. See
:func:`tide.metrics.learning_curve`, :func:`tide.metrics.transfer`, and
:func:`tide.metrics.forgetting` for the matching metrics.
