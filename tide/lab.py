"""The Lab: tide's one public surface.

A Lab is a directory. Inside it live the results database (``results.sqlite``)
and, when the Harbor executor is used, the Harbor trial directories
(``trials/``). Everything a Lab ever does is:

- ``run()``   — execute one episode (a Harbor task under an agent), store the
  trusted reward plus the judge's submission log, and skip work that
  already has a stored result.
- ``df()``    — everything as a pandas DataFrame; metrics are queries.

Persistence lives in the data: there is no daemon, and re-running a crashed
script resumes it because completed keys are skipped.
