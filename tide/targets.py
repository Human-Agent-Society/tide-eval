"""Turning a target into the list of tasks it names.

A target is a task directory, a folder of tasks (a benchmark or a whole
regime), a known benchmark name that downloads on first use, or a Harbor
registry id (``org/name``) that passes through untouched. `tide run`,
`tide stream`, and :func:`tasks` all accept the same ones and expand them
the same way, so a benchmark names the same tasks in the same order from
the CLI and from a script.
