# CL-Bench

[Continual Learning Bench](https://www.continual-learning-bench.com)
([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2606.05661), Apache-2.0): expert-validated
tasks where an agent works through sequential instances of one
environment and should improve by remembering what it saw. Their "system"
(agent plus memory strategy) maps to tide's agent plus carried
`$TIDE_STATE_DIR`, and their gain metric (stateful minus stateless
reward) is `metrics.transfer` against a plain isolated `tide run` sweep.

All six domains are converted: 301 tasks, the benchmark's full instance
count, committed to this repo. One instance = one task; name order
replays each domain's lifecycle. Every scorer is deterministic and
offline.

| Domain | Tasks | What it is | Reward |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bsm-sNN` | 90 | infer a radio band's transmitter layout across scans | availability IoU (0-1) |
| `sales-iNN` | 12 | yearly 5-year demand forecasts from a shifting data room | WAPE-skill (1 = perfect, can go negative) |
| `cohort-iNN` | 20 | rolling survival meta-analysis across biased studies | information gain in bits over the study baseline |
| `code-iNN` | 19 | sequential real-PR bugfixes in tablib, then tenacity | hidden tests pass = 1.0 |
| `dbx-qNN` | 40 | questions over an unknown SQLite db, 15-query budget | 1 − queries/15 if correct, else 0 |
| `poker-hNNN` | 120 | heads-up hold'em vs scripted exploitable opponents | profit in big blinds |

How the conversions work (`convert_<domain>.py` in this folder):

- bsm, sales, and cohort are self-contained predict-and-score tasks; the
  data rooms and scorers use the upstream code, vendored where practical.
- codebase builds on the upstream-published Docker images, prepares the
  workspace at image build the way upstream does at runtime, and the
  verifier replays the upstream evaluation on the exact test node ids.
- dbx and poker keep their hidden state (the database, the deck) in a
  judge sidecar the agent reaches only over HTTP, so the query budget
  and the deal are enforced out of the agent's hands. Decks match the
  upstream harness card for card.
- Agent containers run offline (`network_mode = "allowlist"`), as
  upstream; harness adapters whitelist their own LLM API hosts.

Every task ships a reference solution with a known exact score: the
truth-derived report (bsm and sales 1.0; cohort scores its per-instance
ceiling, recorded as `oracle_score`), the gold PR patch (codebase 1.0),
the direct correct answer (dbx 1.0), or a simulated check/call line
(poker, per-hand `oracle_reward`).

Deviations from upstream, per domain: sales, cohort, and codebase swap
the upstream step- or action-metered interaction for free shell work
under a time budget (codebase's step-count reward becomes pass/fail, and
cohort's six-tool API becomes direct SQLite access); the persistent
workspace is `$TIDE_STATE_DIR` rather than a reused `/app`; and where
upstream delivered feedback conversationally, the instructions carry the
same information (dbx includes the previous question's correct answer).
The dbx query budget and the poker deal are not deviations; the sidecar
enforces them exactly.

The tasks are committed, so they run out of the box:

```bash
tide stream cl-bench --agent claude-code   # every domain, in order
tide stream tasks/continual-learning/cl-bench/poker-* --agent claude-code
tide fetch cl-bench bsm sales    # only to regenerate from the pinned sources
```

Regenerating downloads from the pinned upstream commit and HuggingFace
revisions, sha256-verified; the poker domain also needs
`pip install texasholdem==0.11.0` for the oracle simulation. First runs
are heavy in two places: dbx task images download the published database
(~0.4 GB, cached across tasks by Docker layer) and codebase tasks pull
the upstream repo images.
