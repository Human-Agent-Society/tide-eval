"""The verifier's whole job under the judge protocol: ask the judge for the
final result and write it down.

Generic: task authors never edit this file. It runs inside the task
environment after the agent's budget ends. The judge exposes finalization
on a separate verifier port (``$JUDGE_URL`` with the port incremented by
one) behind a token; this script fetches the token from the verifier port
and calls ``GET {verifier_url}/final`` (final.py on the best submission if
the task has one, else the best session score), then writes:

- ``/logs/verifier/reward.json``: ``{"reward": <float>}``
- ``/logs/verifier/reason.txt``: the human-readable reason
- ``/logs/verifier/submissions.jsonl``: one ``{"t", "score"}`` line per
  submission; tide ingests these as the trusted score-over-time curve.

If ``$VERIFIER_JUDGE_URL`` is set it is used directly; otherwise the
verifier URL is derived from ``$JUDGE_URL`` by incrementing the port.
Falls back to the agent port without a token for old judges that don't
have the two-port separation.
