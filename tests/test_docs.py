"""Claims the docs make that a test can check.

Two of them: every relative link and anchor resolves, and every stated
task count matches the tasks actually on disk. The counts appear in
three places, which is one page for the site, one for the repo landing
page, and one beside the tasks themselves; checking them here is what
keeps three copies from drifting apart.

Vendored and generated task directories are skipped: their markdown comes
from upstream and is not ours to fix.
