"""Quickstart: the Lab API in 30 seconds, offline.

No Docker and no real agents run here. The FakeExecutor simulates episode
results so the shape of the thing is visible: resume, tags, trace rows,
the DataFrame. The agent names below ("strong", "weak") are labels the
fake scorer reacts to; they are not defined anywhere else.

Real runs replace the FakeExecutor with the default HarborExecutor and a
real agent:

    tide run autoresearch/first-party --agent claude-code --model ...
    python examples/minimal_harness.py                      # your own harness

    python examples/quickstart.py
