"""Best-effort final-artifact submission for the Codex harness.

Under Tide's judge protocol the verifier's only input is the judge's
submission log — the final reward is the best submission, and zero
submissions score 0.0 no matter what the agent left in the workspace.
OpenEvolve and CORAL submit structurally (every evaluation spends one);
Codex is only *told* to submit by the instruction. This script closes that
gap: when the judge saw zero submissions, spend one on the agent's final
artifact. When the agent already submitted, best-of semantics cover the run
and there is nothing to do — no budget is spent and no score the agent
never confirmed enters the trace.

Never fails: any error (no ``JUDGE_URL``, no artifact, budget exhausted,
judge unreachable) just skips the submission, so the trial is unaffected.
