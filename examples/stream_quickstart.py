"""A continual-learning stream in 30 seconds, no setup.

The agent is simulated: each task it writes one line into its carried
state directory and scores by how many lines it has accumulated, so the
reward rises only because the state travels from task to task. Swap in
real tasks and a real agent when you have Docker; see the README.
