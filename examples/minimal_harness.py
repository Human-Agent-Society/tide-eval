"""The smallest complete agent harness: ~25 lines of adapter, no LLM.

Pairs with ``minimal_harness_search.py`` (the random-search loop) to show
the full integration path end to end: put your method in the container,
point it at the judge, and get back a trusted score plus the judge's
submission ledger as trace rows. Requires Docker +
``pip install tide-eval[harbor]``.
